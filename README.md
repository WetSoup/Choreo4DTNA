    <h1>Who We Are and Why We "Danced The Night Away"</h1>
      <p>At Whitney High School, there is a pinch of students in Dance I. To be frank with you, I don't believe there is an Advanced Dance class (although it's listed as one of the school courses). Although a small class, it was a blast for us all. We especially enjoyed practicing the Barbie Movie choreography of "Dance the Night Away" by Dua Lipa. This song was nothing short of perfect for us; from its disco theme to its sensuality, the song was great for a class like ours Our teacher, Ms. Improta, took inspiration from the original choreography and added more to pizazz to it. She asked for our feedback and if we felt comfortable with particular moves, and we always did! Learning the dance was superb, but dancing in front of the entire school was amazing to an indescribable level.</p>
